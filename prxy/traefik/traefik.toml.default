# Barebone configuration file for use with backends outside of your Docker instance
# - Copy this template file to create your *.toml file/s
# - Replace $ with a unique identifier
# - Add URL to backend
# - (Add additional backends, if Traefik is supposed to also provide load balancing.)
# - Define entry point/s (the wapps default ones are: "https" on port 443 and
#   "https-mgmt" on port 4443)
# - Define frontend rules
#
# For a complete configuration reference, please visit https://docs.traefik.io/configuration
