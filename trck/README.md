## Trck App

Out of the box, the trck app only uses rudimentary geolocation. Follow this [Matomo FAQ](https://matomo.org/faq/how-to/#faq_163) to download the Maxmind gelocation database and improve the accuracy of your analytics data. Place the downloaded Maxmind database in the ``misc`` subfolder of this app, then (re-) start the app: ``docker-compose up -d``
