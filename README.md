# Why Self-host?

There are two reasons why I host the above apps myself:

* Cost: I would pay substantially more for consuming the software as a service than hosting it myself.
* Privacy: I do not entrust the provider with my sensible data.

# Requirements

Apart from ``docker-compose`` and its dependencies (Docker 17.06.0+ and Docker Compose 1.14.0+), this repository requires two conditions to properly work: one regarding SSL certificates, one with regard to Docker networking.

## SSL Certificates

For the time being, the prxy app (i.e. Traefik) currently relies on two specific files:

* tls.pem: the SSL certificate for your domain
* tls.key: the private key for the SSL certificate

The assumption is that each app runs on its own subdomain and that all apps are covered in the given SSL certificate. A version with support for dynamic certificates from [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is on the to-do list.

## Docker Networking

Before starting any app, you first need to create the two networks that the apps use. Enter the following two commands:

```
$ sudo docker network create wappsfrontend
$ sudo docker network create wappsbackend
```

Use the flag ``--subnet`` in case you want to define the CIDR notated IP ranges (i.e. ``10.11.12.0/24``) of these two networks.

# Customization

Most apps require customization before they can be deployed. These apps contain one or more ``.default`` files in the respective app folder. Copy those files and rename the copies to match the original file excluding the ``.default`` suffix (i.e. copy ``.env.default`` to ``.env``). Then set the empty variables in the files to fit your needs.

Apps that are considered publically available (see Availability column in the table above) can be reached over ports ``80`` and ``443``; private apps can be reached over port ``4443``. This gives you the option to limit the traffic to private apps via firewall.

For further instructions, please refer to the ``README.md`` files in the respective app subfolders.
